# Todo List Example

A simple todo list application demonstrating file persistence and CRUD operations.

## Features

Initial implementation:
- Add tasks
- List all tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Save to JSON file

## Incremental Enhancements

Test continuation by adding:
1. Task priorities (High, Medium, Low)
2. Due dates
3. Categories/tags
4. Search functionality
5. Export to CSV

## Usage

```bash
python todo.py
```

## Testing Continuation

This example demonstrates:
- Working with persistent data (JSON)
- Modifying existing data structures
- Adding new functions without breaking existing ones
- Maintaining backward compatibility

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Existing tasks are preserved
- ✅ Old data format is migrated gracefully
- ✅ All original features continue to work
- ✅ New features integrate smoothly
